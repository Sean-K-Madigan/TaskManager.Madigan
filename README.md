# Task Manager built with Third Part API's

## Project Description

The goal of this application is to allow the user to track and organize tasks in the browser. The user will be able to change starter code by interacting with a modal pop-up on the page and subsequently dragging items between the various colums on the page.

## User Story

```md
AS A project team member with multiple tasks to organize
I WANT a task board 
SO THAT I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project progress accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a task board to manage a project
WHEN I open the task board
THEN the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)
WHEN I view the task board for the project
THEN each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)
WHEN I click on the button to define a new task
THEN I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog
WHEN I click the save button for that task
THEN the properties for that task are saved in localStorage
WHEN I drag a task to a different progress column
THEN the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing
WHEN I click the delete button for a task
THEN the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved tasks persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Demonstrates my ability to effectively employ applications that rely on Web-API's such as J-Query, Bootstrap, and DayJS for time, design and function.
